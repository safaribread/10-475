      # Lab meeting: 
        # 1) redo metadata files and check and make sure all of them have (smoker status) 
        # 2) and if needed, convert some data types (e.g. if the smoking level is classified in numbers, convert it) 
        # 3) and give each data line a “source” file to cleanly say which study it came from 
        # 4) And finally combine the metadata files 
              # Try to do it on R, but if not, do it on Excel 
        # 5) Run the chime process for the data sets independently - don't trim them all the same. Trim them as you need to
              # ^if the datasets were all single/paired-end reads and their reads were the same length, you could treat them all the same from the import, but unlikely 
        # 6) Use the Qiime command to merge the data files 
        # 7) DataWrangling section on the proposal: describe how the metadata tables were consolidated
